      <h2> This is my Data Set app that was created for an assignment in the class. This app is based on the anime One Piece, the show has fruits called devil fruits that gives the user who consumes it powers. This app is like an encyclopedia of some of the devil fruits in the anime, showcasing their rarity, strength, and type. There is also a hidden page the powerful screen, if you get a Quake-Quake fruit try pressing the ? button to see what happens.
